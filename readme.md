The Dwarfs learned long ago how to manipulate lava to their will. By building their furnaces directly above lava, they can smelt metals and bake goods for a long time without hauling buckets about. Now, you can too. Build your furnace directly above a lava block, then punch the furnace to ignite it. Punch it again to douse the flames. No fuel/buckets needed!
